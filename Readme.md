## Cropzilla [WIP]

This is a funny e-commerce project themed around selling farmer's goods for Godzilla food.

LOL.

I will try to apply the Clean Code concept, Effective Java and SOLID principles.

### Stack

- Springboot
- Keycloak
- Docker
- AWS (IDK I think I will choose Digital Ocean)

### Book Resources

- Effective Java Third Edition by Joshua Bloch
- Software Architecture Patterns by Mark Richard
- Clean Code by Robert C. Martin

If application doesn't run you can try to run docker manually, then run this app again
